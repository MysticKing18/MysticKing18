## Hi,I'm Luke!😎


ABOUT ME
<hr>

I’m still learning, and to be honest, I get lost sometimes. I don’t always know exactly what I want yet 🥲, but I do know that I want to keep moving forward. There are days when I question if I chose the right path, but since I’ve already started, I want to see it through until the end.

I stumble. I overthink small problems. Sometimes I feel discouraged and fall behind others. I used to compare myself a lot to people who seemed more talented, not realizing that they’re also fighting their own battles. Now, I’m slowly learning to focus on my own growth, even if it takes me longer than most. Progress is still progress.

I’m pursuing a future in IT, even as a slow learner. I may not be the fastest, but I’m consistent, and I’m willing to work hard to improve little by little. I believe that with patience, effort, and faith, the hard work will eventually pay off. I’m not doing this alone—God is with me every step of the way 😎 He’s my No. 1 backer.

My goal is simple: to grow, to become better than I was yesterday, and one day, to live a stable and meaningful life.
